### Viewing Installed Packages

We can check out your installed packages using the list subcommand:
```$ pip3.6 list```

You may have gotten a deprecation warning. To fix that, let’s create a $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf file:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/pip
$ vim ~/.config/pip/pip.conf
~/.config/pip/pip.conf
[list]
format=columns
```

Now if we use list we’ll get a slightly different result:
```$ pip3.6 list```
```
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        9.0.1
setuptools 28.8.0
Installing New Packages
```

Later in this course, we’ll be using the boto3 package to interact with AWS S3. Let’s use that as an example package to install using the install subcommand:
```$ pip3.6 install boto3```

PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ```'/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jmespath'```
Since we installed Python 3.6 into /usr/local, it’s meant to be usable by all users, but we can only add or remove packages if we’re root (or via sudo).
```$ sudo pip3.6 install boto3```

### Managing Required Packages with requirements.txt

If we have a project that relies on boto3, we probably want to keep track of that dependency somewhere, and pip can facilitate this through a “requirements file” traditionally called requirements.txt. If we’ve already installed everything manually, then we can dump the current dependency state using the freeze subcommand that pip provides.
```
$ pip3.6 freeze
boto3==1.5.22
botocore==1.8.36
docutils==0.14
jmespath==0.9.3
python-dateutil==2.6.1
s3transfer==0.1.12
six==1.11.0
$ pip3.6 freeze > requirements.txt
```
Now we can use this file to tell pip what to install (or uninstall) using the -r flag to either command. Let’s uninstall these packages from the global site-packages:
```$ sudo pip3.6 uninstall -y -r requirements.txt```

### Installing Packages Local To Our User

We need to use sudo to install packages globally, but sometimes we only want to install a package for ourselves, and we can do that by using the --user flag to the install command. Let’s reinstall boto3 so that it’s local to our user by using our requirements.txt file:
```
$ pip3.6 install --user -r requirements.txt
$ pip3.6 list --user
$ pip3.6 uninstall boto3
```
