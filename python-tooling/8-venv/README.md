### Virtualenv or Venv

Virtualenvs allow you to create sandboxed Python environments. In Python 2, you need to install the virtualenv package to do this, but with Python 3 it’s been worked in under the module name of venv.
To create a virtualenv, we’ll use the following command:
```$ python3.6 -m venv [PATH FOR VIRTUALENV]```
The ```-m``` flag loads a module as a script, so it looks a little weird, but ```“python3.6 -m venv”``` is a stand-alone tool. This tool can even handle its own flags.
Let’s create a directory to store our virtualenvs called venvs. From here we create an experiment virtualenv to see how they work.
```
$ mkdir venvs
$ python3.6 -m venv venvs/experiment
```
Virtualenvs are local Python installations with their own site-packages, and they do absolutely nothing for us by default. To use a virtualenv, we need to activate it. We do this by sourcing an activate file in the virtualenv’s bin directory:
```
$ source venvs/experiment/bin/activate
(experiment) ~ $
```

Notice that our prompt changed to indicate to us what virtualenv is active. This is part of what the activate script does. It also changes our $PATH:
```
(experiment) ~ $ echo $PATH
/home/user/venvs/experiment/bin:/home/user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/bin
(experiment) ~ $ which python
~/venvs/experiment/bin/python
(experiment) ~ $ python --version
Python 3.6.4
(experiment) ~ $ pip list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        9.0.1
setuptools 28.8.0
(experiment) ~ $ deactivate
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
```
With the virtualenv activated, the python and pip binaries point to the local Python 3 variations, so we don’t need to append the 3.6 to all of our commands. To remove the virtualenv’s contents from our $PATH, we will utilize the deactivate script that the virtualenv provided.
